# Sensation and Perception 
WHERE NEUROSCIENCE MEETS BIOLOGY 

| SENSE   | VISION  | HEARING |TOUCH   |BALANCE |TASTE/SMELL|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| stimulation| electromagnetic | air pressure | tissue deformation | acceleration | chemical composition |
| receptor | photo receptor | mecano receptor | mecano receptor | mecano receptor | chemical receptor |
| sensor/structure | eye | ear |skin |vestibular |mouth/nose |
| engineering | camera | microphone |pressure / thermometer |IMU |gloves...etc |

# Vision + Hearing + Balance
1. VECTION
   1. Eyes's think the object is moving - example of being in a stationary train and another starting to move.

2. VESTIBULO OCULAR REFLEX
   1. Affects stationary perception - example of moving head with a fixed pencil in fron of your eyes.
   
> If you have a bad set of VR Headset your head compensates for it without you knowing it. Dangerous.
   
# Psychophysics
PHYSICAL STIMULATION TO PERCEPTION PHENOMENA.

> There are many studies of psychophysics on different inputs with 'probability of detection' charts.

# Steven's Power laws (1961)
P=CM^x
> Where is demonstrated that human behaviout tends to ADAPT over time.

# Optical Illusions
> Check and Study the classic to see how there are 'rules' to trick the vision percieved by the brain
