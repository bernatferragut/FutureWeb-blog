# You have to take the power back - Part One

> You made it you bought different Altcoins and Bitcoins...now you have to track them

## Crypto Folios - How to track your assets

Once you have spend more than you wanted in cryptos, one day you wake up and you realize that is a big mess what you are doing. Some of your assets are in the Trezor, others in the Ledger, other in digital bitbox. And it's all good you check out in Internet...sure there is a dude who has created a free online Portfolio.

And then you check them all...and after a deep research you pick up 3 of them like:
1. CryptoCompare
2. AltPocket
3. BlockFolio

And then you introduce your data to their website...and while you are doing...you think, wait a moment...what the hell I'm doing?

## Everybody knows ... but only if you want

> There must be a better way of doing this no? YES - CODE IT

So that's a small intro to the small adventure of creating your own Crypto Folio App.
An App that will run solely in from your Computer and in this way you and only you will be able to see which are your holding...or your HODLS.

## Crypto Folio V.1.0

> This was a first attempt of generating the App

Objectives:

1. Use of the oldest and more reliable form of HTTP calls: XML Http Request
2. Use of simple and easy Vanilla Javascript HTML and CSS, no FX.
3. Use of sinple Boiler Plate. I did use Skeleton for this purpose.
