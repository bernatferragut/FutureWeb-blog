# Creative Coding and the Art of Teaching

## How too many JS libraries brought me to the basics

### 3 Months of Teaching Creative Coding to Kids

The last 6 months have been what could be seen as an involution if we only touch the surface. I wanted to teach how to code since the last year but 
the opportunity because I was all the time travelling did not appear. Having come back to Montreal finnally I could start to teach coding through an
amazing NGO called kidscodejeunesse.org. These last 3 months have been a blast from a human perspective because of the amount of things I could give 
and the amount of things that came in return because of the kids. It's been an amazing experience that I'd like to continue doing for a while, even 
to bring it down south to my beloved South America in the future.

### Scratch

Don't fool yourself because it looks like an innocent Lego Blocks game. Scratch is a programming language developped by the MIT especifically to bring 
computational thinking to kids. You can do and learn the basics of programming through a very friendly interface and you can do almost anything: From Animations,
Interviews to Games and Interactive experiences. It has been a very interesting way toask myself the basics of programming again, to dismantle and relearn
what I thought I already knew and to teachit again. Do you wnat to know about something ? Teach it, that's the only way.
  
Here I give you a link to the online software. The actual version is in Flash and by the T1 2018 we should have the new version that it's being developed 
fully in javascript. Off course, our beloved JS had to come back again. As somebody once said: 'If something can be written in JS, one day it will be'.

### From complex Libraries like Angular to Just Vanilla JS

And this was a relief my friends. After so much time learning different frameworks last year I decided to comeback to the basics and just
come back to creative coding with just plane JS or Vanilla JS as it's also coined.

Here you can see some examples that have been done recently and applied in Codpen. It's a comnbination of mainly 2 concepts:
> CANVAS HTML5
> VANILLA JS
> OOP - Object Oriented Programming

### P5JS

Few years ago it was ActionScript and Flash, later came Processing ( with JAVA ) and today we have the Javascript version of
Processing called P5JS. Although everything can be done with plane JS, I have to admit that a good library like P5JS helps a lot inmost cases.

I think that today if you are into Creative Coding and Generative Art the P5JS libraryis the best choice. Here the link:

From Physics Simulations, to Fractals. From OOP to Biological Algorythms, P5JS has all the necessary tools to continue to 
grow as a creative coder. I will post my work that it's being made at the moment mixing Lullian creative creative code and Biological 
algorythms in the following 2018. Happy end of the year 2017 and I wish you a super exciting 2018 !!!
