# Notes on Alger's Manifesto 
### HMD (Head Mounted Display) 
> Everything will happen throught HMD. They are the new headphones.

### Invent things that are 'Natural' to use
> We should design natural things that we can recognize naturally.

### 'Interaction Design' is the Key
> It's the glue that binds Graphic and Motion Design in the VR world.

### Good inventions are 'Technology Independent'
> Drag and Drop, blue hyperlink, clickwheel, pinchzoom.

### Ideas to TRY
> Environnement attention cues, holophonic notification sounds, pointing,
viewports, shadows, day and night cycles, weather, interpersonal UI icons.

### The job of the future will look quite different than now. 
> The 'normal' will be to work inside the HMD with different screens (spherical and not reactangular as an example)

### Graphic and Web Designers will have to readapt.
> They will have to approach the Interior and Architecture designer more and more. They will have to study 'space'.

### Which will be the future of Keyboards and Desktop
> Different approaches to have a new 'office space' adapted to your imagination.

### The Operatios System has to be redisgned for productivity and Multitasking
> A new whole approach has to be studied because the technology allows a new paradigm.

### We do it For the better
> It can change the world
> Education can be more engaging
> Training more effective
> Things can be better designed if you can live inside them before building them for real.
> Freedom to visit and go whatever you wish whenever you want.
> The Internet does not have to be in 2D anymore
> We want to relax and enjoy our imagination.
