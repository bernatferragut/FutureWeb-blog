# VR Design Process

> Google's Daydream Labs guidelines for the best possible approach to VR Design

### Design process 1
> Rapid, exploratory prototyping

* Rapid prototyping
  * 2 People Generalist - Designer and Programmer
  * Like a 2 day Game Hackatoon spread over 5 days

* Brainstorm ideas where people from Outside plays an important role
* Rank the ideas
* Implement
* Document the findings -  this is vital
* Scope for 2 days and stretch to 5 days to prevent burnout

### Design process 2
> Iterative, production-oriented design

* Traditional tools and approach simply do not work
> VR first and as quickly as possible to the platform

* Daydream design scheme flow
  * Main branch - Interaction designer and Prototype as the base
  * User Research
  * Environmental Design
  * 3D Art Design
  * Visual Design
  * Sound Design

* VOLUMETRIC LAYOUT DESIGN - CYLINDRICAL APPROACH TO PRESENT INFORMATION
* FLATTENING WINDOWS WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN USE
* VOLUMETRIC LAYOUT DESIGN - CYLINDRICAL APPROACH TO PRESENT INFORMATION
* FLAT IMAGE GOES TO 3D THROUGH PARALAX ONLY WHEN NEEDED
* MOTION AS AN ENGAGING ONLY WHEN NEEDED
* SOUND AT THE END SO TIMINGS ARE PERFECT
