> A-**FIRST INTERACTION DESIGN PROTOTYPING**

  * WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR - INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN - LIKE MOBILE FRAMEWORK
  * FLOWS TO GOALS TO THE USER TO ACCOMPLISH

> B-**HAND SKETCHING - ONLY 2D STAGE OF DESIGN PROCESS**

  * Easiest and fastest way to share your ideas - faster than Photoshop.
  
> C-**VOLUMETRIC LAYOUTING** - in 3D immediately see how it look in VR

  * In 3D immediately see how it looks in VR / SPACIAL DESIGN
  * SCALE - EYE TRAVEL -HEAD MOVEMENT - MORE
  * ADD TEXT - IMAGES - INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS ( IT HAS DEPTH AND DISTORTION IN 3D )
  * POSITIONING IN 3D - OVER a CYLINDRICAL MAKES MORE SENSE AND IS EASIER TO SEE
  * INCREASE LEGIBILITY - DECREASE THE LAYOUT SIZE So is less claustrophobic
  * ADD HIGHER FIDELITY FILLER CONTENT
  * ADD HIGHER FIDELITY FILLER CONTENT

> D-**START USER SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN**

  * START USER SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN
  * WE INTRODUCE ENVIRONMENT DESIGN
  * WE INTRODUCE 3D MODELLING - DISCOVERY POSTERS - VISUAL DESIGN
  * ELEGANT FLATTENING WINDOW WHEN 3D NOT NEEDED - INCREASE PARALLAX WHEN NEEDED
  * TRANSITIONS + INTERACTIVITY + 3D MODELS
  * MOTION DESIGN
  * LIGHTING + MATERIALS
  * SOUND DESIGN
