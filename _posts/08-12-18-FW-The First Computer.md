## Computational Thinking

The outstanding Catalan philosopher and theologian Ramon Llull (c.1232–1316) encourages us to reread the late Middle Ages. 
Llull, not only theoretically and linguistically invented a new method of knowledge acquisition, like an engineer, 
he also mechanized it, and translated it into a machine.

Llull’s ars combinatoria was a method based on divine intuition for generating truths by means of a logical algebraic language.
The method Llull invented was universal in its aspiration and, introduced a modern way of learning. 
It postulated the unity of the various disciplines of knowledge of his day, and through deduction, argumentation, and dialogue.

The reverberations of Lullian thought on technology, art and culture find their present-day corollary in a pedagogical revolution 
which has “computational thinking” at its core.

## Ars Brevis / Ars Infusa

After diving into it's most known piece of art, the Ars Brevis ( the smaller version of the Ars Ultima ), I have found the need
to rewrite a brand new site with the foundations of his computational thinking.

Following the steps of the Llullist Yannis Dambers I have reedited the Ars Infusa English translation of the original latin one.

Adding the code in javascript for each of the pieces has created a rather new mix of old and new, that puts on to the table 
the incredible moment to study again this pioneet of computational thinking and re evaluate and study all his theories from a modern
and contemporary point of view.

I hope you like it and more important that you try to use it...so to say ... let's compute with Llull again.
