# Future web - Progressive Web Apps- the new core technologies of the web

## Everything changes

Internet never stops. The technologies that only 5 years ago were the latest are 
obsolete again. Websites? Forget it, now they are called Web Apps. Exactly the
same way we had cellphones and now we have smartphones. 

Years ago,  websites were mainly made of a simple structure with static content. Now, they are complex interactive websites connected to dependencies, services and web API's. More than that, before they were made of pages and now they are made of components. 

## Components

Components are everywhere, like customizable Lego pieces, components are the present and future of the web, where people trade components to take their web apps to a new level.

As we have talked in the latest blog posts, the tendency is to design thinking in components. If all started when we had discovered that's how 3D Unity Engines 
work inside, then we saw this same model is being adopted from VR to the Web VR.

## Angular

The best example in Web development is Angular (Angular2 and Up) developed by Google. Angular is a Web Component based JS framework and because of this specific architecture, it's leading the way we are building websites now. As a side note also is designed from the bottom up with Typescript, a Javascript superset that enables to structure code in a more OOP way, helping in the overall performance and maintenance of the App.

## PWE

So here we arrive to this new concept of a ' progressive web app' or PWE. This web apps are apps or websites that try to behave as much as possible as mobile native apps for android or osx. Native apps are fast and responsive, delivering an amazing 'experience' when using them: fast, ergonomic and reliable. 

After only 3 seconds half of your potential clients will leave your website if you are not fast enough providing them with content. That's why web apps have to behave and provide native apps like feeling the more and more if they want to be competitive. That' the reason why from just web apps now we are entering to the new world o progressive web apps.

## Visual Design

To show how complex are getting Apps I have created this visual design so we can see how many lines of code are being produced to generate a standard Web App today. As a comparison the 1991 first Unix Os system had 20K lines of code. We are entering in an age of hyper complexity where the gap between people who can understand code and the people who cannot is getting bigger.
