# AR - Vuforia Platform

## First impressions

When I think about the difference between VR and AR, it comes to my mind the
difference between a Prius and a Volt, one it's an electric-gas hybrid and the other 
a full electric one.

Exactly because this reason I have hesitated to enter and fiddle with AR for sometime
but recently and thanks to some excellent tutorials from ![MatthewHallberg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClm2DY6pj3ygKoKhEVr7KFw) on the youtube channel
I decided to give it a try.

> Note on the used versions
I have started using the last Unity version by February 2017, the 5.5.0f3 with the last 
Vuforia 6.2 on the Osx Mac Version. Do not use the this one because image targets are not recognized,
instead downgrade to a more stable version like the 5.4 of Unity, then all will be fine.

The Vuforia SDK is relaively easy to use and the company allows developers to have access to ome test versions for
free after being properly registered.

At its base Vuforia SDK converts your phone into a 'Tracking' device. You can choose between 4 tracking types:

1. Single image
2. Cuboid
3. Cylinder
4. 3D Object

I have used the Single image and Cuboid and it works pretty well. Still have some delay but this 
must be because I'm using a small laptop while travelling around the world. I guess with a powerful desktop computer this
issue would be solved and latency largely diminished.

### Is it worth

Absolutley yes, although I do think AR is a mere transition to VR it has it's place and I would say,
like the Prius, it's here to stay for longtime. The possibilities of incorporating useful, funny or misterious
elements in our reality to help, entertain and hopefully make us happier are enormous.

Happy to say that, I expected less and I will give it more chances in the near future.

Give it a try :)
