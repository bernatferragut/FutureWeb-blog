## 3 VR Experimental Projects with GoogleVR SDK

**1.Distances Project**

**2.Planets Project**

**3.Maze Project**

### Things I have learned building the first 3 VR Projects

**1.Speed of moving forward a character has to be relatively slow to avoid motion sickness**

> We will give preference to smooth walks at low pace when moving in a 3D Space

**2.The scale of things has to be relatively *"Real"* and to scale to avoid having too much head rotation** 

> Do environnements "To Scale when possible and putting the head hight to more or less 1.80m above the floor.

**3.Sudden head movements have to be avoided > Create dumping factors when rotating the head in the future**

> It's temptating to add buffering factors on the head rotation to avoid a "dry rotation". It's not recommended in places
> like the Oculus website, but it is worth a try even for small values.

**4.WayPoints work well but can be a little bit confusing at the beginning**

> Alltough highly recommended in VR Study Programs like Udacity, seems to me that have to be used in "certain specific" moments
> and when it is very clear the direction to take and you can imagine what is going to happen.

**5.Combining a slow forward motion with some Way points in key areas can work well**

> Just a good balance of both movements can work well for starting projects.

**6.Effects in 3D are great , like the rain effect on the Maze**

> Effects with realistic physics in 3D like rain, wind sound, lights work very well but use just when they really can help.

**7.Jumping, if you know you are going to jump, can work (Itâ€™s like the head prepares for it in advance)**
(*NOT RECOMMENDED because different kind of people can get motion sickness)**

> Although Jumping / going upstairs still being a big no in the VR community. Depending how is designed maybe can work
> I've been 'jumping' quite a lot in VR recently and more experimentation has to be done. It's about to find the 'right' settings.

**8.Music is very important in 2D and 3D it puts the personality and immersion to the game**

> 2D and 3D Music are super important, they give the other 50% into the Experience. More experimentation with 3D effects needed.

**9.Colors and textures can be very simple (flat shadding with occlusion ) / Harmonious color palettes can simply work**

> Flat, simple, well balanced color scales work very well instead of heavy textured areas.
