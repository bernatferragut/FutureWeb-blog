# SOFTWARE SETUP

1. Download Java SE Development Kit 8 [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
Install it.

2. Download Android Studio [link](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started-android)
Install using the “SDK Tools Only” option.
On some Windows systems, the launcher script does not find where the JDK is installed. If you encounter this problem, you need to set an environment variable indicating the correct location.
Select Start menu > Computer > System Properties > Advanced System Properties. Then open Advanced tab > Environment Variables and add a new system variable JAVA_HOME that points to your JDK folder, for example C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_77.

> **A-FIRST INTERACTION DESIGN PROTOTYPING**

  * WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR - INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN - LIKE MOBILE FRAMEWORK
  * FLOWS TO GOALS TO THE USER TO ACCOMPLISH

> **B-HAND SKETCHING - ONLY 2D STAGE OF DESIGN PROCESS**

  * Easiest and fastest way to share your ideas - faster than Photoshop.
  
> **C-VOLUMETRIC LAYOUTING** - in 3D immediately see how it look in VR

  * In 3D immediately see how it looks in VR / SPACIAL DESIGN
  * SCALE - EYE TRAVEL -HEAD MOVEMENT - MORE
  * ADD TEXT - IMAGES - INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS (it has depth and distortion in 3D)
  * POSITIONING IN 3D - OVER a CYLINDRICAL MAKES MORE SENSE AND IS EASIER TO SEE
  * INCREASE LEGIBILITY - DECREASE THE LAYOUT SIZE (so it's less claustrophobic)
  * ADD HIGHER FIDELITY FILLER CONTENT
  * ADD HIGHER FIDELITY FILLER CONTENT

> **D-START USER SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN**

  * START USER SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN
  * WE INTRODUCE ENVIRONMENT DESIGN
  * WE INTRODUCE 3D MODELLING - DISCOVERY POSTERS - VISUAL DESIGN
  * ELEGANT FLATTENING WINDOW WHEN 3D NOT NEEDED - INCREASE PARALLAX WHEN NEEDED
  * TRANSITIONS + INTERACTIVITY + 3D MODELS
  * MOTION DESIGN
  * LIGHTING + MATERIALS
  * SOUND DESIGN
