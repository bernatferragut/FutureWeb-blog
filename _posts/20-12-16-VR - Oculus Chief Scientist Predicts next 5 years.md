# Michael Abrash, Oculus Chief Scientist Predictions

> Michael Abrash 

Michael Abrash, writer of the classic graphics programming [Black Book](http://giant.pourri.ch/Graphics%20Programming%20Black%20Book/Graphics%20Programming%20Black%20Book.pdf)  and Oculus Chief Scientist, 
did very good predictions in his 2014 article: [What VR could, should and certainly will be in the next 2 years](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf).

As what seems it's starting to be a 'tradition', in his last Oculus Connect presentation has again thrown his
visionaries and realistic predictions about where VR will be in the next 5 years. 

Here I present the main points of his most recent video about it.[VR Michael Abrash Presentation](https://youtu.be/AtyE5qOB4gw)

>Massive improvements in VR hardware and software over just five years will make current headsets seem like "something out of pre-history"

## 1.Panel Resolution
* Today: **1200 x 1080**
* In 5 years: **4K x 4K**
* What humans are capable of: **NA**

## 2.Pixel Density
* Today: **15 pixels/degree**
* In 5 years: **30 pixels/degree**
* What humans are capable of: **120 pixels/degree**

## 3.Field of View
* Today: **90 degrees**
* In 5 years: **140 degrees**
* What humans are capable of: **220-320 degrees**

## 4.Depth of Field
* Today: **fixed at 2m**
* In 5 years: **variable**
* What humans are capable of: **variable**

###FOV
To achieve a 4K x 4K we will have to achieve: 'foveted rendering'.

This is a technique where only the tiny portion of the image that lands 
on the fovea—the only part of the retina that can see significant detail—is 
rendered at full quality, with the rest blending to a much lower fidelity 
(massively reducing rendering requirements).

###EYE TRACKING
Estimating the position of the fovea requires “virtually perfect” eye tracking, 
which Abrash describes as “not a solved problem at all” due to the variability of pupils, 
eyelids, and the complexities of building a system that works across the full range 
of eye motion for a broad userbase. But as it is so critical, Abrash believes it will be 
tackled in five years, but admits it has the highest risk factor among his predictions.

###VIRTUAL SOUND
In addition, he expects advancements to the modelling of reflection, 
diffraction and interference patterns will improve sound propagation to a more realistic
level. Accurate audio is arguably even more complex than visual improvement due to the 
discernible effect of the speed of sound; despite these impressive advancements, 
real-time virtual sound propagation will likely remain simplified well beyond five years, 
as it is so computationally expensive.

###CONTROLLERS
On controllers, Abrash believes hand-held motion devices like Oculus Touch could remain 
the default interaction technology “40 years from now”. Ergonomics, functionality and 
accuracy will no doubt improve over that period, but this style of controller could well 
become “the mouse of VR.” Interestingly, he suggested hand tracking (without the use of 
any controller or gloves) would become standard within five years, accurate enough to 
represent precise hand movements in VR, and particularly useful for expressive avatars, 
and for simple interactions that don’t require holding a Touch-like controller, 
such as web browsing or launching a movie.

###HEADSETS
Headsets will be lighter in five years, with better weight distribution. 
Plus, he says, they should have more convenient handling of prescription correction 
(perhaps a bonus improvement that comes with depth of focus technology). 
Most significantly, at the high end, VR headsets will become wireless.

###AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)
“Augmented VR”would scan your real environment to be rendered convincingly in the headset, 
or it could place you in another scanned environment. This could serve as the ultimate 
mixed-reality ‘chaperone’ system for confidently moving around your real space, 
picking up real objects, and seeing who just walked in, but also to make you feel like you 
were anywhere on the planet, blurring the line between real-world and VR. 

We can expect a huge number improvements to the believability of sharing a virtual space 
with others, but staying on the right side of the uncanny valley will still be the goal 
in five years he believes. It could be decades before anyone gets close to feeling they 
are in the presence of a “true human” in VR.

###DREAMWORK SPACE
Abrash revisited his “dream workspace” he discussed last year, with unlimited whiteboards, 
monitors, or holographic displays in any size and configuration, instantly switchable 
depending on the task at hand, for the most productive work environment possible. 

Add virtual humans, and it becomes an equally powerful group working tool. 

But in order for this to be comfortable to use as an all-day work environment, all of the 
advancements he covered would be required. For example, the display technology would need 
to be sharp enough so that virtual monitors could replace real monitors, augmented VR 
would need to be capable of reproducing and sharing the real environment with accuracy, 
the FOV would need to be wide enough to see everyone in the meeting at once, and spatial 
audio would need to be accurate enough to pinpoint who is speaking. Not every aspect of 
this dream will come true in five years, he says, but Abrash believes we will be well 
along the path.
