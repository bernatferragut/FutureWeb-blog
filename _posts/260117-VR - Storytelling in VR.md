## Great minds talking about VR storytelling

### ED CATMULL - Pixar Cofounder

> "It's good buit it's not Storytelling (Linear Storytelling). The fact that you have changed the technology,
and people are excited about it, doesn't change the underlying difficulty of the compelling narrative story. 
Just as books are not the same thigs as movies. They don't have to be."

> "Linear narrative is an artfully directed telling of a story, where the lighting and the sound is all for 
a very clear purpose. You are not just wandering around in the world. ( pretty tough one sir)"

> " Games is a very successful. It's its own art form though, and it's not the same as linear narrative."

### ROBERT STROMBERG - Oscar winning director & VFX Specialised

> Creator of the " Martian VR Experience" and VRC Director

> " VR is a cross-pollination between what you might consider a live performance and cinematic storytelling."

> "It's kind of a hybrid -â€“ a cross between an observer and a participant.
I think that's going to be the definition of how you tell a story: Are you an observer, or are you a participant? If you look at it as a stage play, you go to a theater and watch a performance live and you have a choice of where to look onstage. If you were to put yourself on the stage, it would be a different experience. You would feel like you were intruding if you were just an observer, and if you got right up in people's conversations you would feel awkward because you would feel like you're a part of it. We're doing a lot of psychological tricks with storytelling where you're a watching a performance as opposed to being part of it or you're in an interactive setting and you want to see a character in the story."

> " One of the biggest things I learned from The Martian was that the brain was so tuned in that you had to make sure the horizon was accurate. Otherwise your mind tells you something's wrong. There was one portion where people had an uncomfortable feeling, but when we cracked the horizon issue it went away. So everything is still being wind tunnel tested. Over time we'll learn what does and doesn't make somebody comfortable. I think maybe there'll be a rating system for VR where you'll know going in what level you're comfortable with. "

> "In VR we have to have enough entertainment value and enough content out there for people so it's an ongoing and growing part of people's daily lives."
