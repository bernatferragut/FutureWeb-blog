### Great Minds talking about VR Storytelling

## Ed Catmull - Pixar Cofounder

> "It's good buit it's not Storytelling (Linear Storytelling). The fact that you have changed the technology,
and people are excited about it, doesn't change the underlying difficulty of the compelling narrative story. 
Just as books are not the same thigs as movies. They don't have to be."

> "Linear narrative is an artfully directed telling of a story, where the lighting and the sound is all for 
a very clear purpose. You are not just wandering around in the world. ( pretty tough one sir)"

> " Games is a very successful. It's its own art form though, and it's not the same as linear narrative."

### Robert Stromberg - VFX Specialised ( wokred with Sodebergs, Socrsese and Spielberg )
