## THE SINGLETON PATTERN

![interaction](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17754060/20390726/822801fa-aca6-11e6-94d4-781800a38f9b.jpg)

### Context

> If You are building an application in C#. You need a class that has only one instance, 
and you need to provide a global point of access to the instance. The Singleton Pattern is the way to go.

1. EASIEST PATTERN TO LEARN
4. PROVIDES ONE INSTANCE THAT HANDLES THE LOGIC
5. EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND MANTAIN

### Implementation Strategy

> Even though Singleton is a comparatively simple pattern, there are various tradeoffs and options, 
depending upon the implementation.
