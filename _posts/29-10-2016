### Compare 2 AUDIO or VISUAL SYSTEMS

1. AUDIO
   1. Inside a 7.2 Surround 3D System Audio room VS Regular used Headphones. 
   2. Factor the Distance from the source in both systems.
   3. When we move the effect on both how different it is.
   
2. VISUAL
   1. Inside a visual 'Cave System' VS phone headset 'glued' to the head.
   2. Factor the Distance from the source in both systems.
   3. When we move the effect on both how different it is.
   
 # Questions

> Why we like to have the music as Static inside our head vs the Visual movile to achieve good VR?
> Seems we like to have this source of sound from within constantly and the more detailed sense of vision in movement.
