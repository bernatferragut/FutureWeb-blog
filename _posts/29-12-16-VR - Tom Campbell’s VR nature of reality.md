# Tom Campbell, The Nature of VR & and my BIG TOE

> A Visionary Scientist supporting the VR nature of reality

I discovered Tom Campbell in 2008, and read through his trilogy [My BIG TOE](https://www.my-big-toe.com/) during that same Summer and the Summer of 2009. 

At the time, I was really absorved and profoundly shocked by his 'vision' that the nature of reality is purely VR. Mainly by the fact that 'the consciousness' is the 'Computer we live in'.

The years have passed and as he 'predicted', his theory is taking place as a 'philosophical' and 'physical' view of the reality. Against the 'traditional' Science, he is putting into place a theory that merges things like Relativity and Quantum Physics for the first time. But How ? Well, because under his point of view we live in a Virtual Simulated Reality, and this is the only way we can explain two different and opposite theories.

The more I keep listening to him the more I get why is so important to understand and approach the future of VR with a 'VISION and AIM' on how it works the 'VR Rule Set' so we can impact for the better the evolution of this new technology. 

The AIM might seem strange, but it's beautiful and profound. 

We are here in this reality to decrease the 'ENTHROPY' of the main system or said in other words: TO LOVE. 

It's about the OTHER and not about OURSELVES. 

I do believe it's very important the VR Community discovers him because he can help us drive the technology in a more 'Cosntructive' way. **Yes it's about Play, Yes it's about games and about VR Experience but...deep inside it's About Love.**

Couldn't be better, isn't it true? . ** Welcome to Tom Campbell's BIG TOE.**

## 1.Tom Campbell [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Campbell)

>Thomas Warren Campbell (December 9, 1944) is a physicist, lecturer, and author of the My Big T.O.E. (Theory of Everything) trilogy, a work that claims to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics, and metaphysics along with the origins of consciousness. The work is based on the simulation argument, which posits that reality is both virtual and subjective. Campbell agrees with other notable philosophers and scientists including Hans Moravec, Nick Bostrom, Brian Whitworth,[1] Marcus Arvan[2] and others who hypothesize that reality is a simulation generated by a computer (or peer-to-peer network according to Aravan),[3] while Campbell contends reality evolved from a "digital big bang". These ideas are heavily influenced by the concepts of digital physics.

## A.Work with NASA and DoD
Campbell has had a long career as a scientist and physicist. He received a B.S. in Physics as well as an M.S. in Physics. His Ph.D. work specialized in Experimental Nuclear Physics with a thesis in low-energy nuclear collisions.[4] He worked as a systems analyst with Army technical intelligence for a decade before moving into the research and development of technology supporting defensive missile systems. Subsequently, he spent the better part of 30 years working within the US missile defense community as a contractor to the Department of Defense.[4] Campbell most recently worked for NASA within the Ares I program (follow-on to the Shuttle) assessing and solving problems of risk and vulnerability to insure mission and crew survivability and success.[4][5]

## B.Work with Bob Monroe
After receiving his master’s degree in physics in 1968, Campbell commenced on a Ph.D. program with a specialization in experimental nuclear physics.[4] During this time, Campbell enrolled in a Transcendental Meditation class and discovered an aptitude for it, a technique he says he would employ to discover errors in his computer code while working for Army Intelligence.[5] Around this time, Campbell was introduced to Bob Monroe’s book, Journeys Out Of The Body, on out-of-body experiences. Upon learning that Monroe was looking for scientists to help him study altered states of consciousness, Campbell applied for the position and subsequently began working with Monroe at Monroe Laboratories. This research facility would evolve to become The Monroe Institute. Tom is the "TC physicist" described in Monroe's second book Far Journeys.[6] Both Campbell and electrical engineer Dennis Mennerich were instrumental in developing TMI’s "Hemi-Sync" technology, based on the binaural beat method for creating specific altered states of consciousness within subjects.[7] Campbell believes his research with Monroe informed many of his insights into the nature of reality and mechanics of what he calls "the larger consciousness system".

## C.My Big TOE (Theory of Everything)
The My Big TOE trilogy develops a complete derivation (in outline) of consciousness. This derivation begins with two assumptions and then proceeds to logically derive all the attributes, limitations, properties, qualities, and mechanics of consciousness – what it is, where it comes from, and how it works. The two assumptions are 1) that consciousness exists as a self-changing information system capable of evolving and 2) that evolution exists as a process of natural selection. Neither assumption is particularly remarkable,[5] and both fit comfortably within common experience and everyday scientific understanding.[5]

Since its publication, My Big Toe has garnered an international following with Campbell’s videos, as of December 31, 2015 having had more than 2 million views on YouTube and 309 videos of his lectures, public appearances, interviews, and fireside chats explaining fundamentals, nuances, implications and applications of his theory. He continues to lecture around the world, holding workshops on M.B.T., teaching workshops on the principles of simulation theory and speaking at conferences on the topic of consciousness.[8]
