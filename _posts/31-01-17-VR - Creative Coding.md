## Creative Coding

> Since back in the ActionScript Flash days, creative coding has been changing from platform to platform.
More recently Programming languages like [Processing](https://processing.org/)( Java inspired ) and Ps5 [P5js](https://p5js.org/)( Javascript based ) have made great improvements in how to implement creative coding with new technologies.

> Recently, because my main interest is VR and Creative Coding, I found out how big is the lack of creative coding projects
in the 3D Unity platform. The possibilities with Unity are amazing and I do agree is kind of the 'new Flash' or the new tool
which when properly understood ( YES, you need to learn how to code OOP in 'C#') the possibilities are limitless.

> This gentlemen, Mr.Rick Barraza, seems to be the man who wants to point out how to use Unity with a more open mindset than the classical gameOriented ones where Art, Design and Creativity play a new role. Let's have a look on his interesting thoughts and advices.

### [Rick Barraza](http://rbarraza.com/)
> Design strategy and creative engineering at Microsoft

### What is Design?

We can imagine the Tree as the 'Process of design' and the Fruits as it's 'Artifacts or consecuences'.

A. Design is a 'noun' and a 'verb'

B. If you are a designer you DO design as an action

> Design is the process of human centered problem solving. Resolve problems FOR humans. Why? of the solution first.
> The collection of delightful artifacts produced at the end of that process can be also design.

C. The best design products have a tight iteration between design ( the WHY ) and ingeneering ( the HOW ).

### What is Creativity?

We can imagine Creativity as the Soil underneath from which the Design tree grows.

>  If you do not invest in 'creativity' you can not sustain 'design' in your company.

Creativity requires 4 Components:

A. EXPLORATION
> Access the non verbal brain, time to explore parallel thinking

B. EXPERIMENTATION
> Start converging all these ideas in a Skeching format through intuition

C. FREEDOM TO FAIL
> A culture of creativity bakes freedom to fail at its process core

D. FUN
> Bring your passion and  mix it with the solution to find something unique.

### What is Creative Coding ?

A type of computer Programming where the goal is: 
> to create something 'Expressive' instead of something 'functional'.

A. When you are Production Optimized you are focused in solving a problem so can be scaled.

> Traditional Programming is learned as Lego pieces: Object Oriented, Reusable, Repeatabl and Dependable.

> Focus on Predictability and Scale.

#### Creative Coding came with Flash and Processing

A. We approach Code more like CLAY and not LEGO.

B. Here the difference between Engeneering Software and Creative Coding

C. Code as a 'second language' that enables to express your passion with code as the modern medium today.
