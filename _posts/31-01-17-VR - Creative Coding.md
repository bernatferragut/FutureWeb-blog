## Creative Coding

> Since back in the action script Flash days, creative coding has been changing from platform to platform.
More recently Programming languages like ![processing](https://processing.org/)( Java inpsired ) and Ps5 ![p5js](https://p5js.org/)( Javascript based ) have made 
great improvements on how to implement creative coding with the new technologies.

> Recently, because my main interests are VR and Creative Coding I was seeing how big the lack of creative coding projects
in the 3D Unity platform. The possibilities with Unity are amazing and I do believe is kind of the new Flash or the new tool
that when properly understood ( yes you need to learn how to code OOP in C#) the possibilities are limitless.

> This gentlemen, Rick Barraza seems to be the man who wants to point out how to use Unity with a different mindset than the
classical gameOriented one where Art, Design and Creativity play a new role.

### What is Design?

We can imagine the Tree as the 'Process of design' and the Fruits as it's 'Artifacts or consecuences'.

1. Design is a 'noun' and a 'verb'

2. If you are a designer you DO design as an action

> Design is the process of human centered problem solving. Resolve problems FOR humans. Why? of the solution first.
> The collection of delightful artifacts produced at the end of that process can be also design.

3. The best design products have a tight iteration between design ( the WHY ) and ingeneering ( the HOW ).

### What is Creativity?

We can imagine Creativity as the Soil underneath from which the Design tree grows.

>  If you do not invest in 'creativity' you can not sustain 'design' in your company.

Creativity requires 4 Components:

1. EXPLORATION
> Access the non verbal brain, time to explore parallel thinking

2. EXPERIMENTATION
> Start converging all these ideas in a Skeching format through intuition

3. FREEDOM TO FAIL
> A culture of creativity bakes freedom to fail at its process core

4. FUN
> Bring your passion and  mix it with the solution to find something unique.

### What is Creative Coding ?

A type of computer Programming where the goal is: 
> to create something 'Expressive' instead of something 'functional'.

1. When you are Production Optimized you are focused in solving a problem so can be scaled.

> Traditional Programming is learned as Lego pieces: Object Oriented, Reusable, Repeatabl and Dependable.

> Focus on Predictability and Scale.

#### Creative Coding came with Flash and Processing

1. We approach Code more like CLAY and not LEGO.

2. Here the difference between Engeneering Software and Creative Coding

3. Code as a 'second language' that enables to express your passion with code as the modern medium today.
