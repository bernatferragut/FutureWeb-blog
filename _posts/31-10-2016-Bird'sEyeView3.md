# HARDWARE REVIEW

### DISPLAYS

A.VISUAL
   1. Projectors
   2. Visual Screens ( CTRL, LCD, OLED )
   3. Virtual Retina Displays (Directly projected to the retina)
   4. Light Field Display

B.AUDIO
   1. Speakers, Earphones
   2. Bone Conduction

C.TOUCH
   1. Haptic devices
   2. Cuaneous vs Kinestesia

D.SMELL
   1. Research of Chemical Stimulae > A Lot of research at the moment.

> Ususally the user wants to meove a large distance through the interface and gets the 'sickness motion effect'.

### COMPUTER CPU's and INPUT DEVICES

1. GAME CONTROLLERS
2. KEYBOARD / MOUSE
3. DATA GLOVES > A lot of research right now

# Questions

> Tracking is key -  The closer to the eye the more complex has to be.
> Problem about how to see your body inside the game > Either a lot of tracking required...or simply use a 'cave system'.

### TRACKING HARDWARE

A.IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
   1. For Orientation, Rotation Estimation
   2. Measures ( 3D angular Velocity with a Gyroscope )
   3. Measures ( 3D angular accelerator with an accelerometer )
   4. Today becane really affordable because of the smartphones usage and mass production.
   5. Magnetometer ( To measure the magnetic fields )

### CAMERAS

A.INSIDE / OUT
   1. The head moves and the distance is tracked to outside fixed dots.
   2. Depth INFO ( RGBD )

A.OUTSIDE / IN
   1. The head moves with dots in it and there is a fixed camera ourside to track.
   2. Depth INFO ( RGBD )
   
# SOFTWARE REVIEW

INPUTS // Head Tracker, Game Tracker, Keyboard --> ALTERNATE WORLD GENERATOR (AWG) --> Visual and Audio Render -->
          Visual and Audio Display --> Output sensor Organs --> Fool the Brain to Fool your Body.
          
# Super Imposing Alternate and Local Real Worlds

> Decide the Physics ruleset and the Ruleset of the World we are creating

### Two Kinds of SELF MOTION

A. Comfortable
   1. The user moves and its motion is matched in the alternate world
   
B. Uncomfortable
   1. Through the interface the user moves it's virtual self

> Ususally the user wants to meove a large distance through the interface and gets the 'sickness motion effect'.

### GAME ENGINES

1. UNITY
2. UNREAL
3. YOUR OWN ( with Python for example tailored to your exact VR needs ).
   
# Questions

> The entire experience needs to be redesigned because game engines were created for games not for VR.
> We need to design a VR Engine, a new AWG - Alternate World Generator specific for the new specifications needed.
