# VR

### Objectives

We immerse the person into a loft with real measures and give them the possibility to Like/Dislike certain items in it. Once the person has visited upstairs and downstairs we can see which are the objects that he/she liked and the ones he/she disliked through the use of a mini realtime DB in VR.

		script.likes = ES2.Load<int> ("likes");
		lks = script.likes;
		textLoaderL.text = script.likes.ToString();

		script.dislikes = ES2.Load<int> ("dislikes");
		textLoaderD.text = script.dislikes.ToString();
